# Train-Scheduler

*Georgia Tech's Coding Bootcamp Week 7 Homework*

This is a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. It retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. This website provides up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

This app runs in the browser, and it uses JavaScript for the logic, jQuery to manipulate HTML, and Firebase to store data.
